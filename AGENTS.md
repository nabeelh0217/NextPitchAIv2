# NextPitchAI v2 — agent context

Read this before touching anything. It is the memory of record for the
project: what it does, how it is wired, the rules that must not be broken,
and where we are. `docs/EXPERIMENTS.md` holds the run-by-run history.

## What this is

A model that predicts the **next pitch type** an MLB pitcher will throw
(10 canonical Statcast classes: FF, SI, FC, SL, ST, CU, KC, CH, FS, KN)
from game state, matchup history, and the pitcher's own recent sequence.
The softmax is **masked to the pitcher's real arsenal inside the model**,
so it can only ever predict pitches that pitcher actually throws. A Flask
website (`site/`, not yet built) will serve these predictions.

## File map

| Path | Role |
|---|---|
| `01_scrape_statcast.py` | Pulls 2022–2024 Statcast pitches via pybaseball → `statcast_raw_v5.parquet` (atomic write) |
| `02_preprocess.py` | Leakage-free feature engineering → `data_v5/` arrays, scalers, ID maps, website artifacts |
| `03_train.py` | BiLSTM + embeddings + arsenal-masked softmax, class-weighted focal loss → `data_v5/best_model_v5.keras` + `eval_report_v5.txt` |
| `evaluate_model.py` | Regenerates the evaluation report from the saved model (same split, no retraining). `03_train.py` imports its `build_report` so the two can't drift |
| `run_pipeline.sh` / `run_pipeline.bat` | One-command runners (macOS/Linux, Windows). Skip completed steps; validate artifacts |
| `docs/EXPERIMENTS.md` | Every training run, its numbers, and its verdict. **Append a row after every run.** |
| `.cursor/rules/` | Cursor-scoped rules (point back here) |

`data_v5/` and `*.parquet` are gitignored (GBs). The `_v5` file naming is
kept for runner continuity even though the schema is v6 — `meta_v5.json`
carries `"version": 6`.

## How to run

```bash
./run_pipeline.sh                    # macOS/Linux: everything, skipping done steps
./run_pipeline.sh --fresh-preprocess # rebuild data_v5/ + retrain, keep parquet
./run_pipeline.sh --fresh            # redo all, incl. the 30-90 min scrape
run_pipeline.bat                     # Windows equivalent (--fresh only)
```

Needs Python 3.10–3.13 (TensorFlow has no wheels for newer). The runners
find one automatically and manage `.venv`. The scrape hits Baseball
Savant directly — it cannot run from sandboxed/proxied environments.

## Hard invariants — do not break these

1. **No label leakage in priors.** Every historical feature (arsenal
   prior, matchup history, batter seen-profile, whiff rates) is an
   *expanding* statistic computed over PRIOR rows only, excluding the
   current pitch (`expanding_prior_dist` / `expanding_prior_rate` in
   `02_preprocess.py` subtract the current row's one-hot after the
   cumsum). Any new historical feature must follow the same pattern.
2. **Chronological sort first.** `02_preprocess.py` sorts by
   `game_date, game_pk, at_bat_number, pitch_number` before any prior or
   sequence is built. Priors and sequences are meaningless otherwise.
3. **Sequences are per (game_pk, pitcher).** The lookback window is the
   *same pitcher's* previous pitches. The v4 approach (previous N rows of
   the game) mostly captured the opposing pitcher — never regress to it.
4. **Arsenal mask semantics.** `X_arsenal_mask` is 1 for every pitch type
   the pitcher threw ≥1 time in the full dataset. It is a model INPUT;
   `03_train.py` adds `(1 - mask) * -1e9` to the logits before softmax.
   Every training label is unmasked by construction. Unknown pitchers at
   inference get an all-ones mask.
5. **Split before any resampling; evaluate on the natural distribution.**
   Never oversample/duplicate rows before `train_test_split`. (v6 has no
   resampling at all — class balance is per-class alpha in the focal
   loss.) Reported metrics are always on the untouched validation split.
6. **One change per training round, logged.** Runs take an hour+.
   Change one thing, retrain, append the result to
   `docs/EXPERIMENTS.md` with the verdict, then decide the next change.
7. **Atomic artifact writes.** `01_scrape_statcast.py` writes to a `.tmp`
   and `os.replace`s into place; the runners refuse a parquet < 1 MB. A
   corrupt/empty artifact silently reused cost a full re-scrape once.

## Evaluation vocabulary

`03_train.py` prints top-1, top-3, a per-type classification report and
confusion matrix, and a **baseline** ("always predict this pitcher's most
common pitch type", from training rows). Judge the model by its *lift
over that baseline*, and by top-3 (what the website will show). 10-class
top-1 will read lower than the old 4-bucket numbers — that is expected.

## Current status (2026-09-18)

- v6 has had its **first real training run** on the MacBook Air (Python
  3.13.15). Curves: 28 epochs, val loss plateaus ~epoch 18 with no early
  overfitting — the class-weighted loss fixed v5's memorization problem.
  The evaluation text was lost with a closed terminal; regenerate with
  `.venv/bin/python evaluate_model.py` and log it in `docs/EXPERIMENTS.md`.
- Then: decide tuning vs. lock the model and build the Flask site.

## Conventions

- Scripts are flat, numbered, config-at-top; keep that style.
- Comments explain constraints the code can't show (leakage reasoning,
  why a value was chosen), not what the next line does.
- Never commit `.venv/`, `data_v5/`, `*.parquet`, `*.keras`, `*.npy`,
  `*.pkl`.
